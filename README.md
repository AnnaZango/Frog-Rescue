## Description
Sea level is rising! Your mission is to rescue a small population of frogs before the sea water reaches them. Catch three frogs per level or the exit door will not open! And don't hesitate to bump on the head of those Climate Change deniers: they will try to stop you! 

## Development
This game was developed with Unity and C# during the participation in the course Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D, given by GameDev.tv Team on Udemy. All assets and animations, except music and sound effects, were developed by me. Music and sound effects were taken from OpenGameArt. Fonts were downloaded from DaFont.
